<p>For round 1, I had the following assignment:</p>

<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Suspense</p>

<p><strong>Subject</strong>: A wedding</p>

<p><strong>Character</strong>: A chef</p>

<p>I had one week to write a story of no more than 2500 words based on the above.</p>

<p>Something Borrowed, Something Virulent</p>

<p>by Neil Chazin</p>

<p>“Don’t worry Gina, the food will be ready on time, and I’ll be there to help you get ready by elven-thirty tomorrow. Sleep well, I love you sis.” Cynthia Reynolds said before hanging up her phone.  She crawled into bed, setting her alarm for 4:00 AM, knowing that she had to have all the food prepared and ready to go out to the onsite kitchen by 11:00 AM the next day.</p>

<p>She slept well, and by four thirty she was in her prep kitchen, conveniently around the corner from her loft apartment, turning on the ovens and getting ready for the chefs who would soon be arriving. Ben, her assistant and best friend from college, was the first to arrive, and together they wrote out assignment sheets for the four temporary chefs who were hired to assist in preparing the meal for the nearly three hundred wedding guests. By 5:00 AM they all arrived, and began sharpening their knives for their individual tasks.</p>

<p>Cynthia considered the meal Gina and her Fiancé planned for their wedding. While she always knew her sister was a foodie, she didn’t expect the complexity and variety of the meal when she offered to cater the meal as her wedding gift. The appetizers, including seared scallops with pea puree, medallions of beef tenderloin with freshly grated horseradish, and delicately spiced samosas, had to be carefully prepped and assembled. The main courses of New York steak and salmon had to be vacuum packed and slid into the sous vide baths so they could gently come up to their final temperatures.  The vegetables for the salads had to be carefully prepped and put into individual containers, for last minute assembly on chilled plates. Various sauces and dressings had to be made. Cynthia was well versed in preparing the food for a big wedding, but this was the first time she had to leave the kitchen early to actually be in the wedding she was cooking for.  She knew that Ben could handle running the show at the onsite kitchen, and that their friend José, who was one of the assistant chefs, would help him sear the proteins and do final assembly. </p>

<p>Just before eleven o’clock, she watched as Ben loaded the final silver pan of food into the catering van, and she tapped on the rear door as he and José drove off to the historic mansion where the reception was being held. Her only task left before driving over to her sister’s suite was to sign and hand out checks to the three chef’s hired via referral from the local cooking school.  She had a big smile on her face as she locked the door to her prep kitchen and carried her dress bag to her car, knowing that the day was on schedule, and that the food would be delightful. </p>

<p>Just after she started her car, her phone rang. “Gina, I just sent the van out, I’ll be over to help you finish getting ready in twenty minutes,” she said into the phone without looking at the caller ID.   </p>

<p>“This isn’t Gina,” came the reply, in a deep, masculine voice. “Miss Reynolds, I’m sorry to inform you that my client has instructed me to tell you that one of your cooks has inoculated some of the food with live typhoid bacteria. She also wanted me to tell you that unless you wire $50,000 to her offshore account, the identity of the contaminated food will remain secret.”</p>

<p>“Wait, who is this? Who is your client?” Cynthia’s replied, confused and disturbed by what she heard. She knew that typhoid was terribly infectious and, while treatable, her catering business would be ruined if even a single guest got sick with it. </p>

<p>“Who I am is not important but my client said she is to be referred to as T.S. She also told me to ask you to remember the bake sale. You have until the reception at 6:00PM to wire the money, Miss Reynolds. I will send you a text message with the account number. And don’t even think about calling the police, we’ll know and that will nullify the deal.” </p>

<p>“How am I supposed to get $50,000 dollars?” Cynthia said, her voice wavering in desperation. She had managed to save several thousand dollars over the past few years, but she put almost all the money she made into growing her business. </p>

<p>“T.S. said to also tell you one more thing: Your dad is paying for your sister’s wedding. You aren’t married - perhaps he’ll pay for this instead of a wedding. Either way, pay up or risk infecting your guests. Good bye Miss Reynolds.” He hung up, and Cynthia was left dumbfounded. Her phone soon buzzed with a text message, a series of numbers which she assumed was the account number for the mysterious T.S. Unsure of what to do next, she put her car into gear and started driving toward hotel.  A few minutes into her drive a memory came flooding back into her mind.</p>

<pre><code>    * * *

<p>It was senior year in high school, and the class council was holding a bake sale to raise funds to assist the victims of a typhoon in Asia. The class president, Tricia Salazar, decreed that all the class council members were mandated to provide something for the sale. They mostly did this without complaint, and they even encouraged many of the other students to contribute. Tricia, however, despite requiring the rest of the council to provide baked goods, decided she was too good to ask her parents if she could bake something. Instead she asked her old friend, Cynthia, to bake something for her as well, but to keep it a secret between the two of them. Cynthia readily agreed to help out her friend. On the day of the sale, she came to school with both brownies and lemon bars. She gave the brownies to Tricia, and kept the lemon bars as her own entry into the bake sale.</p>

<p>The sale was a huge success, in fact, and they raised almost $500 for the Red Cross fund, which was a lot more than the students believed they would bring in. Tricia was very pleased, until the next day, in 3rd period English, she was called to the principal’s office. Tricia got a week’s worth of detention for providing brownies with laxatives in them to the bake sale, but would not risk her reputation further by telling anyone that Cynthia was the actual culprit. Instead, she told Cynthia that their friendship was over, and that some day she would have her revenge.  </p>

<p>“Cyn, thank god you’re here, the make up artist is behind schedule but you need to get your hair done ASAP,” Gina didn’t waste any time ordering her sister around as soon as she arrived at her bridal suite.</p>

<p>“Gina, we need to talk for a minute, alone, it’s important.” </p>

<p>Gina looked at Cynthia with confusion, but agreed to follow her into the suite’s bathroom. Once there, Cynthia decided against telling her sister about the truth about threat to the catering. Instead she said, “There were some issues with the ordering and the steaks haven’t arrived. The butcher said they can deliver them to the mansion, and hopefully they will arrive in the next hour, plenty of time for them to be cooked.</p>

<p>Gina screamed, “This is my day, not yours. You have to fix this Cyn!”</p>

<p>“Gina, I think it will be OK. I’ll go call Ben now and see if they have arrived yet, and if not, I’ll come up with a plan B.” Cynthia started to walk out of the room.</p>

<p>“Wait, your hair!” said Gina.</p>

<p>“One or the other, hair or dinner?” </p>

<p>“Fine, make your calls, but be quick,” Gina said, with a frown, and tears streaming down her face.</p>

<p>After she left the suite, Cynthia called her father’s cell phone and got no answer, and no answer from her mother, so she left voicemail with both of them. After thinking about it some more, however, she wasn’t sure that she wanted to involve her parents in the issue, and that she would just have to figure something out. She called up Ben and asked him if he had any money he could loan her. He nervously responded that if she was in trouble, he could find a couple of hundred dollars, and that he knew she was good for it. </p>

<p>“It’s OK Ben, I’m sure I’ll figure it out, thanks for all your help. I’ll catch up with you later on the preparations.” She ended the call, and went back in to her sister’s suite to submit to her hair and makeup treatment, while waiting for her parents to call back. While sitting in the chair, subjecting herself to hair curlers and mascara, she tried to think if there was any other way to get the money, particularly on such short notice. Coming up blank, she resigned herself to cancelling the planned food service. As soon as she had a few moments she made another call to Ben.</p>

<p>“Listen Ben, I know this is a weird request, but I need you to go to the warehouse store and buy enough frozen entrees and appetizers to feed three hundred people.”</p>

<p>“Cynthia, we have food for three hundred people already, why are we getting more food?” Ben replied with remarkable calm.</p>

<p>“Ben, I can’t tell you all the details now, but we may need to serve it tonight. Please, do this for me, you can use the corporate card to purchase it all.”</p>

<p>Ben said that he’d go do it and leave José to finish up working on the food they prepped that morning. Cynthia let him go and tried her parents’ phones again, and still got no answer. Time was running short, it was nearly time to head to the church for the ceremony, and she was beginning to resign herself to the defeat of presenting family sized lasagna and jalapeno poppers to her sister’s wedding guests. It would be almost as damaging to her business as a typhoid outbreak, but at least no one would get sick. </p>

<p>At the Church, Cynthia finally found her parents, but when she went up to talk to her father, she didn’t have the courage to ask for the money. Soon after, Gina pulled her aside and whispered in here ear “You talked to Ben, right, everything will be OK at the reception?”</p>

<p>“Gina, don’t worry, your reception will have be fine. Now go get married, and then we can party.” Cynthia tried to keep her face calm as she spoke to her sister, but her heart was thumping and her stomach was in knots. The ceremony was to begin at 3:00, and afterwards they would head to the mansion for the cocktail hour and the reception. She had just about three hours to go before the end of her life as she knew it but Cynthia knew that for right now, she had to be there for her sister. </p>

<p>The ceremony was lovely, and Cynthia did her best to concentrate on it, and not the terrible situation that she had put herself in. Afterwards, in a towncar with her parents, she finally spoke to her father.</p>

<p>“Dad, if I were in real financial trouble, say if I needed $50,000, would you be able to help me out?” She decided to go with the direct approach.</p>

<p>“Cynthia, I’m sure whatever this is about can wait until after your sister’s wedding, “ her mother said, before her father could speak up.</p>

<p>“I guess so, it’s just that I’ve been trying to get ahold of Dad all day, and neither of you have been answering your phones.” </p>

<p>“Oh, we forgot our chargers at the house, neither of our phones have had power all day,” her father replied, “But seriously, Cynthia, can we talk about this tomorrow, I’m sure we can work something out, if it is really serious, but like your mother said, today is for Gina.”</p>

<p>Cynthia spent the rest of the ten-minute ride in silence, staring out the window, and trying to comprehend how a simple joke over fifteen years ago had sent her life spiraling down. She thought about calling the police, even though her mysterious caller warned her against it, but she didn’t know how she could explain this strange blackmailing even if she wanted to.  She decided that when she got to the mansion, she would go to the kitchen and tell Ben what was going on. </p>

<p>Any hope that he would have a last minute idea was soon dashed. Ben was furious at her for ruining his job, and he stormed out of the kitchen.  José, seeing the argument, came over and asked if there was anything he could do.</p>

<p>“Just keep getting the frozen food ready, José, we’re going to have to throw all the food away, it’s been contaminated.” </p>

<p>José looked at her like she was an alien, but went ahead and started unwrapping trays of frozen food to put through the convection ovens. Cynthia looked over all the beautiful food they had prepared that morning and started crying as she began throwing the vacuum packed salmon into the trash bin.  Her phone rang and she glumly answered it, “Hello?”</p>

<p>“Good evening, Miss Reynolds, “ it was the man from earlier. “My client has decided that you have suffered enough, and to end the ruse. T.S. told me to tell you that she that she had her revenge in watching you squirm and that none of the food is contaminated.”</p>

<p>Cynthia could not believe what she was hearing, “Wait none of it? How can I trust you?”</p>

<p>“It’s up to you if you want to trust me or not Miss Reynolds, but the food is indeed safe to eat, as far as I know. There was never any typhoid or offshore bank account. This was all meant to cause you stress, not to ruin you. You can do with this information as you wish, but if I were in your shoes, I would serve the food.” The man hung up.</p>

<p>Cynthia ran out to the parking lot, where she found Ben smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Ben, what I told you earlier, about the typhoid? It was just a prank, meant to stress me out, please come back and help me finish the food for the reception.” Ben looked at Cynthia and then stamped his cigarette out on the asphalt before saying “You better not do this to me again Reynolds or I’ll be the one seeking revenge” and following her back inside.</p>
